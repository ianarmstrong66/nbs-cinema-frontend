# Luna-Cinemas

## Getting started

Clone the github repository to your drive. It's essential that you clone the appropriate branch and avoid the main branch

When you have files downloaded, I recommend using IntelliJ to edit your code.

You may have dependencies that require you to import. From the main directory in the IntelliJ, right click and open terminal window. 
Here you can type npm i {Name of your dependency} ie. npm i react-router-dom or npm i react-bootstrap
